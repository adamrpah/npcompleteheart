# Law

My current focus is on developing the **S**ystematic **C**ontent **A**nalysis of **L**itigation **E**vent**S** **O**pen
**K**nowledge **N**etwork or [SCALES OKN](http://www.scales-okn.org). This project is a giant effort 
with more than 20 faculty from 10 universities and is funded by the National Science Foundation's
[Convergence Accelerator program](https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/convergence-accelerator/). Our mission
is simple, to transform the transparency and accessibility of court records. My role is in managing
the project and leading the data engineering efforts. 

There are a number of interconnected efforts that are a part of this:

* Developing tools to download and process legal data.
* Developing algorithms to computationally annotate and extract meaning from court records.
* Develop crosswalks to integrate disparate legal datasets.
* Constructing an ontology of litigation actors and events.
* Conducting analyses of court procedures to demonstrate applications of the data.
* Collaborating with partner organizations and supporting their analysis goals with the SCALES OKN.
* Building an open database and applications that enables all researchers and journalists to do the
  same.

The tools that data engineering builds for downloading, processing, and crosswalking legal data will
be released via the SCALES OKN [PACER-tools](https://github.com/scales-okn/PACER-tools) repository.
Data analyses are released via the SCALES OKN
[Research-Materials](https://github.com/scales-okn/Research-Materials) repository.

Personally, my research interests in this area revolve around issues related to access to justice
and judicial decision-making.

## Gun Violence and Terrorism

Two distinct domains, but my interests in both are related to understanding the time evolution and
predictability of these events. This results in a mixture of organizational research, behavioral
contagion, and the impacts of media and publicity.  

## Healthcare

My research in healthcare revolves around the diffusion of new practices, clinician decision-making,
and how workplace networks affect those two. Fortunately, I am a part of a large team with a number
of brilliant individuals who continue to push this research forward to answer these questions.
