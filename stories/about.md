I am a Data|Computational Social|Complexity|Network Scientist. These days I typically just say that
I'm a Scientist, since that is the most important part to me (but I know, it makes
it harder to categorize).  

My focus is on teaching the concepts of complexity, data science, and computational analysis to 
students of all stripes and conducting research. 
My research mission is to find interesting problems that I believe are broadly important to our
understanding of human behavior and our interactions with each other and the environments that we
have built for ourselves. This expresses itself in a number of different
[topics](/stories/research.html).
