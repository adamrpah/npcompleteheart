I am a Data <b>|</b> Computational Social <b>|</b> Network Scientist.  These days I just say that I'm a <b>Scientist</b>.
<br/> <br/>

<h3>Why am I here?</h3>
My focus is on teaching the concepts of complexity, data science, and computational analysis to 
students of all backgrounds while conducting leading research. 
My research mission is to find interesting problems that I believe are broadly important to our
understanding of human behavior and our interactions with each other and the environments that we
have built for ourselves. This expresses itself in a number of different
<a src='/stories/research.html'>topics</a>.
<br/> <br/>

<h3>What don't we know yet</h3>
My primary research focus is on the diffusion of innovations in work-place networks. With
collaborators at McCormick

<h3>So what is NP Complete Heart?</h3>
Some time during my third year of graduate school I became mentally sidetracked by the concepts of
computational complexity; specifically, NP-complete algorithms and the $P=NP$ problem. This interest
was borne out of my first-hand experience trying to use and optimize community identification
algorithms but continued to grow.
The basic gist is that a NP-complete problem is one where you cannot efficiently locate the best 
solution and the problem gets beyond exponentially harder as the problem size increases. 
<br/><br/>
<h3>But you're not a mathematician!</h3>
Together this concept represents to me the incalculable complexities of humans. This incalculable
complexity arises because of our emotions (heart) and through the social systems that we build to
connect with each other. This concept is what weaves into my research, how can we analyze, predict,
and, most importantly, understand the fundamentals of human behavior and our interactions with the
world at large.

School of Engineering and Northwestern Memorial Hospital we study
teams of highly- and similarly-trained individuals adopt new techniques and treatments.
Through both experiments and computational modeling we seek to understand the process behind
the adoption of these new techniques occurs and spreads.

My other research in healthcare is largely focused on the epidemiology of health issues that
are greatly affected by social and environmental inequity. This research includes not only
an interest in the extent of the health issue caused by inequities but also comparing the
relative costs of prevention versus treatment. I have previously done research-related work
to help enable inter-institutional data sharing and analysis while respecting patient
privacy in furtherance of my overall research aim.
<br/><br/>

I am also deeply interested in either predicting or creating predictions while accounting
for missing information. This interest stems from my graduate dissertation work, but my
focus extends far beyond biology now. My focus now includes predicting rare events and rates
of diffusion in social networks given incomplete information.
