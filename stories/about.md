        I am a Data | Computational Social | Network Scientist.  These days I typically just say that I'm a Scientist.
        <br/> <br/>
        My focus is on teaching the concepts of complexity, data science, and computational analysis to 
        students of all stripes and conducting research. 
        My research mission is to find interesting problems that I believe are broadly important to our
        understanding of human behavior and our interactions with each other and the environments that we
        have built for ourselves. This expresses itself in a number of different
        <a src='/stories/research.html'>topics</a>.
        <br/> <br/>

        My primary research focus is on the diffusion of innovations in work-place networks. With
        collaborators at McCormick School of Engineering and Northwestern Memorial Hospital we study
        teams of highly- and similarly-trained individuals adopt new techniques and treatments.
        Through both experiments and computational modeling we seek to understand the process behind
        the adoption of these new techniques occurs and spreads.

        My other research in healthcare is largely focused on the epidemiology of health issues that
        are greatly affected by social and environmental inequity. This research includes not only
        an interest in the extent of the health issue caused by inequities but also comparing the
        relative costs of prevention versus treatment. I have previously done research-related work
        to help enable inter-institutional data sharing and analysis while respecting patient
        privacy in furtherance of my overall research aim.
        <br/><br/>

        I am also deeply interested in either predicting or creating predictions while accounting
        for missing information. This interest stems from my graduate dissertation work, but my
        focus extends far beyond biology now. My focus now includes predicting rare events and rates
        of diffusion in social networks given incomplete information.
