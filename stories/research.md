Currently I am directly engaged in research on:

* Understanding how innovations diffuse is a longstanding research topic, with the early studies on
  agriculture adoption post World War II and antibiotic usage amongst physicians across an entire
  state. However, many questions about what mechanisms were driving the adoption persisted. With the
  advent of massive on-line experiments we have been able to understand influence and susceptibility
  better than ever before. However, we have been limited to testing how online apps or games which have
  little personal cost. I'm interested in how diffusions spread in highly-trained, homogeneous
  groups of individuals.
* In the online world that we live in, it's almost impossible to be sure that we have complete
  information about a social network (unless we work at one of these parent companies of course).
  But how does this missing information affect and disguise the dynamics that we observe? What
  factors is it necessary to capture of these networks to be sure of our conclusions?
* Gun violence is a reality that we deal with daily in the United States; however, when it affects
  our schools it shakes our national consciousness and instills fear. Since 1999 we have expended
  significant resources towards minimizing how deadly such an attack will be, but we still don't
  understand if the problem is decreasing in severity or what is behind these random acts of
  violence. My research analyzes the history and severity of these acts and their interplay with the media.

Do I really research on all of these topics? Yes, and I am always interested in collaborating. 
I am also actively collaborating on:

* Our local neighborhoods affect many things, where we get groceries, who our friends are, even
  where we might work. All of these things impact our health in one way or another. We now have the
  ability to systematically analyze how the environment impacts health on a large-scale through the
  usage of Electronic Health Records. There are many difficulties associated with this though,
  namely that the need to preserve patient privacy runs counter to fine-grained geographic analysis
  in large urban areas. I work on methods to estimate small area case counts given a patient
  population in order to assess disease burden and its relationship to the local environment.

If you are a student looking to conduct research, I am also interested in studying:

* The transmission and evolution of culture
* Irrational actions in rational decision-making processes 
* The effect of gender biases on creative success
