In <a href="http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130422/srep01695/full/srep01695.html">Scientific
Reports</a>.  Just glad to have it published finally. I gave a more complete write up of what this
work means on the <a
href="http://amarallab.org/blogs/2013/apr/26/framework-understand-cellular-processes/">Amaral
Lab</a> website.
