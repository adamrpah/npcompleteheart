![Business Cards](/images/business_card.png)

I finally got around to making my own business cards.  I went with <a href="www.moo.com">moo</a>
because of their quality (I actually got some moo business cards at Datascope Analytics and was
really impressed with them). Overall it was a pretty easy affair using their templates in
Illustrator, if anything the hardest part was choosing what images to use.
