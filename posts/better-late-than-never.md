I've been meaning to post my slides from my dissertation presentation for awhile. In general, I'm committing myself to practicing more "science in the open" (meaning my presentations/posters/code), so here is the embed link. Better late than never I always say.

I gave this presentation at Northwestern University on June 4, 2013 in order to attain the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Biological Sciences. It goes along with the publication <a href='http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130422/srep01695/full/srep01695.html'>"Use of a global metabolic network to curate organismal metabolic networks"</a>. It also goes along with the <a href='metexplore.npcompleteheart.com'>MetExplore</a> application that I've detailed in the projects tab.
