<p>
This was a presentation and sample notebook that I whipped up for the Amaral lab to explain why and some basic hows of using iPython notebooks. This goes along with my previous <a href="http://www.npcompleteheart.com/post/i-wish-i-knew-then-what-i-know-now-reproducible-me/">blog</a> post and has this <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/anonymous/f8e6d8985d2ea0e4bab1">gist</a> to go along with it.
