<p>
I've been working with my friend for awhile now and for the entire length of our project we've struggled to name it.
Over the last week we finally bit the bullet and decided that we would finally name it so other people could start using it.
</p>

<p>
It was a struggle. 
</p>

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>
We weren't really sure what idea or concept we wanted the name to embody so I wrote this script up to try and help.
Given a list of seed words from the command line it gets a number of similar words using the word net corpus.
Then it goes through those words to see if any have an ending that is the same as a generic top level domain.
</p>

<p>
Enjoy!

Script to help in naming/brainstorming web domains
Recursively grabs a number of words that are synonyms to a starting
list of words. Then checks the ends of the words to see if they match 
any of a number of common web TLDs.
