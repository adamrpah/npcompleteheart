We switched from SVN to Mercurial in my lab about a year ago now after we considered all of our
needs as a bunch of researchers, many of whom don't want to care about or are not that interested in
the tools we use.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

In the meantime, I've kept sharing the slide decks I prepped with @frrrmack out of my dropbox folder
with strangers.  That's pretty annoying since I have to add a person's e-mail to it each time. So
I'm putting them here so it'll be quick and easy.

The first one is a quick introduction as to why you would want to switch away from SVN to Mercurial
based on the benefits.  The second is a near exhaustive tutorial on how to do set up and use
Mercurial.

There's definitely some pictures from <a href="http://www.hginit.com">hg init</a> in the
introduction, so thanks for the great picture!

Enjoy!
